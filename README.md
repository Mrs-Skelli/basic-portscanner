# basic-portscanner

```
python3 -m pip install colorama
```

## What It Does:

This is a basic port scanner made in Python 3.7 this port scanner is very simple, straight forward, and above all *basic.* This is nothing fancy or special, it will just list what ports are open on a hostname/IP. It will list all ports that are open between ports 50 and 85. Please feel free to edit that part of the script to your needs. If the port is open, it will print the port number. 

## Why I Made It:

This is my first Python script I made to improve my Python skills, and become familiar with developing programs, scripts, and debugging. This was my first step into the world of both cyber security and programming, therefore the script is really simple. My plan for the future is to develop more complex and useful scripts that could be better used for penetration testing, and ethical hacking in general.

## Will This Script Be Updated:

Probably. If you find an error, bug, or issue with it, feel free to make an issue and I will resolve it when most convienent. 

Finally, I'd like to thank TheCyberMentor, for guiding me and the rest who have purchased his Penetration Testing course in creating this script. This was an eye opening moment for me, and helped me grasp basic programming concepts.
